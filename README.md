Breast Cancer Classification Using Logistic Regression 🧬📊  

Introduction  
This project implements a "binary classification model" using "logistic regression" on breast cancer classification data. The goal is to predict whether a given sample is malignant or benign based on its features.  

Data Preprocessing 🛠️  
Before training the model, the dataset was carefully processed:  
- Handled null values to ensure data integrity.  
- Removed unwanted columns to focus on relevant features.  
- Standardized the features for better model performance.  

Model Training 🎯  
A logistic regression model was fitted on the preprocessed dataset. This included:  
- Training the model on standardized data.  
- Utilizing the sigmoid function, which helps classify the samples into two categories.  

Model Evaluation 📈  
To assess the model's performance:  
- ROC-AUC curve was plotted to analyze its discriminative power.  
- Confusion matrix was used to evaluate classification accuracy.  
- Threshold tuning helped optimize predictions for better results.  

Conclusion 🚀  
This project successfully implements logistic regression for breast cancer classification, with thorough data preprocessing and evaluation. The trained model aids in better understanding and predicting cancerous cases based on medical data, contributing to potential early diagnosis efforts.
